## What is Malta.js?

A tiny (<!-- size -->2.1 KB<!-- /size --> gzipped) client-side JavaScript framework for building Single Page Applications that helps developers to create reusable components with ease. Its reactive architecture allows you to update your UI in real-time as your data changes.

One of the standout features of Malta.js is its support for CSS-in-JS, which allows you to write styles for your components directly in your JavaScript code. This approach can simplify your development process, make your code more maintainable, and lead to faster rendering times.

Unlike some other frameworks, Malta.js does not rely on JSX or similar technologies. Instead, it allows you to create components using JavaScript objects.

## Installation

### npm

```bash
npm install malta-js --save
```
